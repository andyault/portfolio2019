	"desc": "WetStone Tech website was outdated, not responsive, and began running into licensing server issues. Unmaintainable code meant that these issues could not be  xed without reaching out to expensive contractors. Instead, a new website was designed and re ned with employee feedback to give the company a more modern look to attract new clients as well as negate the issues they were facing.\n\nBuilt on top of the WordPress platform, the new site was able to be launched with very little downtime, and the compa- ny was now able to control their own content without having to pay anyone else. The new website also allowed the com- pany to integrate Google AdWords, boosting their search engine presence and allowing them to advertise their product o erings. Technologies used were WordPress, PHP, HTML, CSS and SCSS, and JavaScript."
